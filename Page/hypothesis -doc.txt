PROJECT TITLE
Analysis of Happiness and Well-Being Using Python


1. LIBRARY INSTALLATION COMMANDS
--------------------------------
Run the following commands in terminal / PyCharm terminal:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

(Optional)
pip install seaborn
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn


2. INTRODUCTION
----------------
This project analyzes factors affecting human happiness using Python.
Various financial, health, and lifestyle attributes are used to calculate
well-being scores and visualize relationships between them.


3. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
-------------------------
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib


4. DATASET DESCRIPTION
-----------------------
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Age
- Monthly Salary
- Monthly Expenses
- Monthly EMI
- Sleep Hours Per Day
- Exercise Per Week
- Stress Level
- Friends Support Score
- Family Support Score


5. SCORE CALCULATIONS
---------------------

5.1 Financial Stress Score (1–10)
Formula:
(Monthly Expenses + Monthly EMI) / Monthly Salary × 10

Logic:
Higher expenses and EMI increase stress.
Higher salary reduces stress.
Final score is clipped between 1 and 10.


5.2 Work-Life Balance Score (1–10)
Formula:
(Sleep Hours / 10 × 5)
+ (Exercise / 7 × 3)
− (Stress Level / 10 × 2)

Logic:
Sleep and exercise improve work-life balance.
Stress reduces balance.


5.3 Job Satisfaction Score (1–10)
Formula:
0.4 × Salary Score
+ 0.3 × Work-Life Balance Score
+ 0.3 × Random Satisfaction Factor

Logic:
Salary and work-life balance contribute to job satisfaction.
Random factor represents human variability.


5.4 Physical Health Score (1–10)
Formula:
0.4 × Sleep Score
+ 0.5 × Exercise Score
− 0.1 × Age Factor

Logic:
Exercise has highest impact.
Sleep improves health.
Age slightly reduces the score.


5.5 Mental Health Score (1–10)
Formula:
0.5 × (10 − Stress Level)
+ 0.3 × Friends Support Score
+ 0.2 × Family Support Score

Logic:
Lower stress and strong social support improve mental health.


5.6 Happiness Score (1–10)
Formula:
0.25 × (10 − Financial Stress Score)
+ 0.25 × Mental Health Score
+ 0.25 × Job Satisfaction Score
+ 0.25 × Work-Life Balance Score

Logic:
All major life aspects contribute equally to happiness.


5.7 Happiness Classification
-----------------------------
If Happiness Score ≥ 6 → Happy
Else → Not Happy


6. DATA VISUALIZATION
---------------------
The following graphs are generated:
1. Financial Stress Score Distribution
2. Happiness Score Distribution
3. Salary vs Happiness Score
4. Work-Life Balance vs Stress Level
5. Physical Health vs Mental Health


7. CONCLUSION
--------------
The study shows that happiness depends on multiple factors such as
financial stability, mental health, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.
Salary alone does not guarantee happiness.


8. FUTURE SCOPE
----------------
- Machine learning based happiness prediction
- Real-world survey data analysis
- Advanced statistical testing
